## Description:

Welcome to the Flask-Restful-Include-JWT repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide and example setup for creating a Flask RESTful API with included JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

## Features:

1. Flask-Restful Integration: My Learn documentation how to build RESTful APIs with Flask, a powerful extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs.

2. JWT Authentication: Explore the integration of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication in Flask application. Understand the principles of token-based authentication and how to implement them in this my first Flask RESTful project.

3. Code Organization: The repository provides a well-organized project structure, including modularization of code for better maintainability. Learn best practices for structuring your Flask RESTful projects, i build this just like my javascipt project used nest js but in separate way.

4. Database Integration: Learn how to integrate a database into your Flask RESTful API. The project uses mongoDB, a NoSQL database, and mongoengine, an object-document mapper (ODM), to provide a database backend for the API.

## Project Structure

```arduino
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ database
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ database_config.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controller
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dto
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ helper
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ service
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ route
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ wsgi.py
```

- **config**: Configuration settings for the project, including database configurations in the database subdirectory.
- **controller**: Acts as a bridge between services and requests, handling validation, data serialization, and more using related DTOs.
- **dto**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that define the structure of data exchanged between different layers of the application.
- **helper**: Utility functions and modules that assist in various tasks throughout the project.
- **middleware**: Middleware components that can intercept and process requests before they reach the route handlers.
- **service**: The main business logic of the application. This is where you implement the core functionality of your API.
- **route**: Defines the routes and endpoints of your API.
- **app**.py: The main entry point of your Flask application.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project. You can install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
- **wsgi.py**: The entry point for running your application using a WSGI server.

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-restful-include-jwt.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Follow the documentation to set up your Flask RESTful API with JWT authentication.

## Usage:

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python wsgi.py
```

**Have Fun Exploring ðŸ˜Š**:
Access your API at http://localhost:5000/ and play around with the endpoints. It's that simple!
